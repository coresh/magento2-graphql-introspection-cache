# The configuration for Code Owners for graycoreio/magento2-graphql-introspection-cache
#
#  For more info see: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# ================================================
#  Concepts
# ================================================
#
# A CodeOwner should only review what they are comfortable reviewing. If you're not comfortable, say something.
# It is a CodeOwners responsibility to only accept the changes that they understand and deem necessary.
# The CodeOwners have final say on whether or not code is accepted.
# If multiple CodeOwners are listed, ALL code owners must approve the PR prior to merge.
# CodeOwners work in conjunction with Github's "Number of Required Approvals (1)" requirement.

#  Default Owners
# (in case no pattern matches a path in a PR - this should be treated as a bug and result in adding the path to CODEOWNERS)
